# Programmer Animemes

This is a list of scripts and source files used to generate my memes.
The source media is not included for copyright reasons.

Instructions on how to build each meme are given in their respective directories.
Note that if you choose to use a different encode of the source, you may need to resync the subtitles and video edits.
